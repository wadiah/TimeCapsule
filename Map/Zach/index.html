  I chose this location (Fort Awesome) because it is where I began to record music seriously.
  <br><br>
  At this location, the path of my life changed directions. While living at Fort Awesome, I started to see myself as a music producer and I began my journey as an artist.
  <br><br>
  I could not have and would not have embarked on this journey if it were not for my friends who provided me with just enough support and criticism to keep going.
    <br><br>
  This experience taught me that it is never too late to pursue something that you desire.
  <br><br>
  If I could leave some advice for the future occupants of this location, I would tell them that if you have a dream, you should start pursuing it, now.
  <br><br>
  The link above contains some work from the beginning of my career as a music producer.
