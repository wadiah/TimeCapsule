    <p id="message"><b>A MESSAGE FROM ME TO YOU:</b><br><br>
    If you are a college student, and if you are thinking about changing majors, once, twice, or even three times, do it.<br>
    Don't settle for the easy way out! Learn everything you are interested in. Details are important. Don't skim.<br>
    Spend time with people you love.
