  The house is not actually on fire.
  <br>You walked up the stairs, following the smell of smoke. There is a black mark right next to the door, indicating that there was a fire of some sort. Looks like it even burned a hole through the flooring. You open the door.

  Weird flimsy bodies are just sitting around. Bloodborne plays on the TV while some guy talks about movies in the background. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqdv032mFbg">Sports Men by Haruomi Hosono</a> plays in the distance from another room.
