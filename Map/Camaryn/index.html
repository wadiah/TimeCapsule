I spent a lot of time in this room. Hours and hours of my life have been spent in this windowless tomb with the baby-food-green paint job. There’s antique farm equipment on the walls. I don’t know if it will still be here 10 years from now. God, I HOPE this room doesn’t look the same 10 years from now. It’s not healthy to be in here the whole time! Both physically and mentally.
<br><br>
You need card access to get into this room right now. Only certain people have this card access. It’s a great place to work if you’re looking for no one to bother you. It’s got speakers and a projector so you can blast your music at 3AM and no one is around to hear you and your poor taste in music.
<br><br>
There’s a club that meets in this room. It’s called Rough Secs. No. It’s not a sex club. It’s a motion graphics club. I am its current president. I don’t consider myself an animator, that’s the funny bit. 10 years from now there probably won’t be an animation club at all, or maybe there will be something better in its place instead.
<br><br>
I tried to get the most accurate swatches of the walls that I could. I'm sure one day this room will get painted over. So the original colors shall remain here, somewhat immortalized. Should have considered using <i>purple.</i>
